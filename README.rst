Description
-----------

In a remarkable `paper
<http://www.ams.org/journals/tran/2006-358-09/S0002-9947-05-03919-X/S0002-9947-05-03919-X.pdf>`_
by Ian Agol, Joel Hass and Bill Thurston it was shown that the problem of
deciding whether a knot has a genus g spanning surface is NP complete.  Along
the way, the authors described an algorithm for solving the following problem:

*
   |   Given an equivalence relation on the set *J = {1, ..., N}* which
   |   is generated by *k* order preserving or order reversing pairings
   |   between subintervals of *J*, compute the number of equivalence
   |   classes.

They showed that the running time of the algorithm is amazingly fast --
bounded by a polynomial in *k log N*.

Orbits is a python module which implements their algorithm.
